#### Before you dive in...

This is one of my personal quickstart projects, a repo that I clone to get up and running faster. Commits might be messy, there may be bugs. **I am open to feedback** but this isn't my job.

# Twig & SCSS
This quickstart uses gulp to compile my prefered tooling for a vanilla project. It all compiles down to basic HTML, CSS and Javascript.

 - Twig templating for markup so we can use layouts, imports, and loops... things I've come to love from React.
 - SCSS for styles... because it's not the 90's anymore and we all appreciate CSS with nesting.
 - Babel for compiling modern Javascript. (I'm still new to managing my own babel setup.)
